# Diffusion Model Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the diffusion model. Diffusion is a powerful technique used was widely used in image generation in the recent period.

This a part of my research internship about image to image translation methods.

## Features

- Implementation of the diffusion algorithm
- Support for various diffusion parameters and configurations
- Easy-to-use interface for applying diffusion to images
- Performance optimizations for faster processing

## Installation

To use this implementation, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cinex10/diffusion_model.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can use the diffusion algorithm on your images by running the `diffusion.py` script:

```bash
python diffusion.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

For advanced usage and configuration options, refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory.
